# Event Management System

A simple Event Management System built with React (Frontend) and Node.js with Express (Backend). Users can create, view, edit, manage events, RSVP, and get notified about event updates.

## Frontend (React)

### Tech Stack:
- React.js
- React Router (for page navigation)
- Axios (for API calls)
- CSS (Custom styles)

### Features:
- **Home Page**: Displays a list of upcoming events with the ability to filter by date, location, and event type.
- **Login**: Users can log in using JWT authentication.
- **Signup**: New users can register by providing their name, email, and password.
- **Add Event**: Users can create new events with details like title, description, date, and location.
- **RSVP**: Registered users can RSVP to events, limiting attendees based on event max capacity.

  ```bash
  npm start
- The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.
